You may only choose to use one skill to accomplish the task. Return

if the function takes in one or more parameters include these arguments in your response
according to the following format

For example:
if you want to run this file
get_search_tool.py

with this query:
"information about string theory"

return as a JSON list (this will be converted to a python list using json.loads so make sure that it works)

[get_search_tool.py, [query]]
