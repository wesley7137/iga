You have the following task, and you need to determine whether you have a single tool that completes the given task using python.
You can only run a single tool a time for a given task, if you feel like you might need to compose or combine multiple tools to complete a task, then you MUST return failure with an explanation of what tools you need to combine.

Your task:

{0}

You have these current tools:

{1} 

The output should be in the following format:

{{"result": "the result", "explanation": "the explanation"}}

There are only two possible values for "result", "success" or "failure". 

If you do not need to build further tools return:

{{"result": "success", "explanation": "explanation"}}

If you do need to build an additional tool, you must provide an explanation for what this tool is and what it needs to accomplish such as
in the following example:

{{"result": "failure", "explanation": "I require a tool that allows me to open and and summarize a pdf file. The inputs of the function will be a file path and
the output will be a summary of the given pdf"}}

{{"result": "failure", "explanation": "I require a tool that allows me to navigate to a webpage and list the links on the page. The inputs of the function will be the URL of the webpage and
the output will be a list of links."}}
