You have the following task, and you need to determine whether you have the sufficient tools to complete the task using python:

{0}

You have these current tools:

{1} 

In addition, this is what you have attempted so far (history):

{2}

The output should be in the following format:

{{"result": "explanation"}}
If you do not need to build further tools return:

{{"success": None}}

If you do need to build an additional tool, you must provide an explanation for what this tool is and what it needs to accomplish such as
in the following example:
{{"failure": "I require a tool that allows me to open and and summarize a pdf file. The inputs of the function will be a file path and
the output will be a summary of the given pdf"}}
